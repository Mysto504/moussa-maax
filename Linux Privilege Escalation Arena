Linux Privilege Escalation Arena – Walkthrough Completion
I recently completed the Linux Privilege Escalation Arena on TryHackMe. This room provided a hands-on environment to explore and practice privilege escalation techniques in Linux systems.
Key Details
•	Completed Tasks: 19
•	Difficulty: Medium
•	Learning Mode: Walkthrough
What I Learned
•	Identifying misconfigurations in Linux environments
•	Exploiting common privilege escalation vectors:
o	SUID binaries
o	Cron job misconfigurations
o	PATH variable manipulation
o	Weak file permissions
•	Using enumeration tools effectively to discover potential escalation paths
•	Understanding the difference between theory and real-world exploitation
Why This Matters
Privilege escalation is a critical step in penetration testing and red-team operations. Gaining these skills helps in:
•	Securing Linux environments by understanding how attackers think
•	Strengthening vulnerability assessment and patching processes
•	Preparing for professional certifications (e.g., OSCP, eJPT, PNPT)
Next Steps
I plan to continue practicing more advanced privilege escalation scenarios and apply this knowledge to real-world environments and CTFs.
